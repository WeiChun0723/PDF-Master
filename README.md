**Project PDF Master**

I am writing this proposal for a new PDF editor that will provide a safer environment for my user with a comprehensive solution for editing, merging, annotating and organizing their PDF document. The name of this project is named “PDF Master” and will provide a variety of functionality that will make it easier for users to manage their PDF files.

The core functionalities of the PDF editor will include:

- [x] Adding watermark: Users will be able to add watermark in their PDF file for any application such as loan, rental,and other government process.
- [x] Merging of PDF: Users will be able to combine multiple PDFs into one single file.
- [x] Convert to different file format: Users are able to convert the PDF file into another format such as word document or vice versa convert other format to PDF.

I believe this project will be highly beneficial for the users as most of the time users worried about their uploaded document (e.g. Identity card and bank statement)  will be stored and stolen by the PDF editor online in the market currently. Therefore, I build this project to provide a safer environment for myself or even my users to manage their PDF without any concern.

As this is a free time project hence I will set a timeline which will complete the whole application by the end of the year (31/12/2023).
